**`server.js`**: This is the entry point of the application. It imports the **`FooFest`** object from **`foofest.js`**, sets up an Express.js server, and uses the **`FooFest`** object to respond to HTTP requests.

**`foofest.js`**: This script creates an instance of the **`Festival`** class, named **`FooFest`**. It imports and uses the **`Schedule`**, **`EventLog`**, and **`Booking`** classes, as well as the **`bands`** data from **`Bands.js`**. It sets up the festival, including the schedule, event log, and booking system, and starts the festival.

**`Festival.js`**: This script defines the **`Festival`** class, which manages the overall festival. It uses the **`observer`** object from **`observer.js`** to subscribe to and publish events. It also uses the **`numberToTime`** function from **`numberToTime.js`** to convert numbers to time strings.

**`Schedule.js`**: This script defines the **`Schedule`** class, which manages the festival schedule. It uses the **`shuffle`** function from **`shuffle.js`** to shuffle the bands when filling slots in the schedule.

**`Booking.js`**: This script defines the **`Booking`** class, which manages bookings. It uses the **`observer`** object from **`observer.js`** to subscribe to and publish events.

**`EventLog.js`**: This script defines the **`EventLog`** class, which logs events. It uses the **`observer`** object from **`observer.js`** to subscribe to events.

**`Bands.js`**: This script imports band data from **`bands.json`** and exports it for use by other scripts, specifically **`foofest.js`**.

**`static/bands.json` and `settings.js`**: These static files contain data about the bands and settings for the application. **`bands.json`** is imported by **`Bands.js`**, and **`settings.js`** may be imported by various scripts as needed.

**`util` folder**: This folder contains various utility functions and objects used by other scripts:

- **`events.js`** exports event identifiers used by other scripts.
- **`numberToTime.js`** exports a function used by **`Festival.js`** to convert numbers to time strings.
- **`observer.js`** exports an object used by **`Festival.js`**, **`Booking.js`**, and **`EventLog.js`** to subscribe to and publish events.
- **`rnd.js`** exports functions for generating random numbers, which may be used by various scripts.
- **`shuffle.js`** exports a function used by **`Schedule.js`** to shuffle the bands when filling slots in the schedule.

`src/ Bands.js`

```jsx
const Bands = require("./static/bands.json");
const copy = [...Bands];
module.exports = copy;
```

This script exports an array of band objects that were originally defined in a JSON file:

`const Bands = require("./static/bands.json");`: This line uses Node.js's `require()` function to import the contents of `bands.json` located in the `static` directory. The contents of `bands.json`, which is expected to be an array of band objects, is assigned to the constant `Bands`.

`const copy = [...Bands];`: This line creates a copy of the `Bands` array using the spread operator (`...`). The spread operator essentially takes each item in the `Bands` array and places it into a new array, resulting in `copy` being a new array that contains the same elements as `Bands`.

`module.exports = copy;`: This line exports the `copy` array from this module so that it can be imported and used in other modules. When another module uses `require()` to import this module, it will receive the `copy` array.

`src/ Booking.js`

```jsx
var uniqid = require("uniqid");
const { observer } = require("./util/observer");
const { rndBetween } = require("./util/rnd");
class Booking {
  constructor(fest) {
    this.fest = fest;

```

This file exports a class called `Booking` that handles the entire booking process for the festival. It includes properties and methods to maintain the state of the bookings, reserve spots, fulfill reservations, and adjust the availability of spots over time.:

External dependencies are imported at the top of the file:

- `uniqid` is a simple module to generate unique IDs.
- The `observer` module is imported, which seems to be an event handling system.
- `rndBetween` is a function for generating random numbers within a given range.

The `Booking` class is defined, with several methods to handle the booking logic.

The `constructor` function initializes the object, setting up properties and methods:

- `this.fest` is initialized with the `fest` object passed to the constructor.
- `this.timeoutIds` is an empty array to hold timeout IDs.
- `this.areas` is an array of objects that represent the different areas available for booking, each with properties for the area name, total spots, available spots, and a direction (which seems to be used for deciding whether the number of available spots should increase or decrease).
- A random area is set as sold out by setting its `available` property to 0 and its `direction` to 1.
- The `this.tick` method is bound to the context of the instance.
- The instance subscribes to the `"TICK"` event, calling `this.tick` whenever this event is emitted.

`getData` method returns an array of objects representing the state of the areas, excluding the `direction` property.

`reserveSpot` method handles reserving spots in an area:

- It first checks if the requested area exists and has enough spots available.
- If the check passes, it subtracts the reservation amount from the available spots and sets a timeout to add the spots back after `this.fest.reservationDuration`.
- An ID for the reservation is generated and added to `this.timeoutIds` along with the timeout ID and other reservation details.
- It then returns an object with a success message, the reservation ID, and the reservation timeout duration.
- If the check fails, it returns an error message.

`fullfillReservation` method allows a reservation to be fulfilled given an ID:

- It searches `this.timeoutIds` for the given ID.
- If the reservation exists and hasn't expired, it cancels the timeout, removes the reservation from `this.timeoutIds`, and returns a success message.
- If the reservation doesn't exist or has expired, it returns an error message.

`tick` method represents a time tick in the system:

- It first checks if a random number is less than `this.fest.eventChance`. If this check passes, it randomly selects an area and changes its available spots according to its `direction` property.
- If the number of available spots is 0 or less, it sets the `direction` to 1 and the available spots to 0.
- If the number of available spots is more than 20, it sets the `direction` to -1.

At the end of the file, the `Booking` class is exported.

_________________________________

- `var uniqid = require("uniqid");`: This line imports the `uniqid` module, which generates unique IDs.
- `const { observer } = require("./util/observer");`: This line imports the `observer` object from the `observer` module. This is presumably an instance of the Observer pattern, which allows for subscribing to and publishing events.
- `const { rndBetween } = require("./util/rnd");`: This line imports the `rndBetween` function from the `rnd` module. This function likely generates a random number between the two arguments it's given.
- `class Booking {`: This line starts the definition of the `Booking` class.
- `constructor(fest) {`: This line starts the definition of the `Booking` class's constructor, which is a special method that gets called when a new instance of the class is created. The constructor takes one argument, `fest`, which represents the festival for which bookings are being made.
- `this.fest = fest;`: This line assigns the `fest` argument to the `fest` property of the `Booking` instance.
- `this.timeoutIds = [];`: This line initializes the `timeoutIds` property of the `Booking` instance as an empty array. This array will be used to store information about ongoing reservations.
- `this.areas = [...];`: These lines initialize the `areas` property of the `Booking` instance as an array of objects, each representing a different area of the festival that can be booked. Each area object has properties for the name of the area (`area`), the total number of spots (`spots`), the number of available spots (`available`), and a direction value (`direction`).
- `const areaIndex = rndBetween(0, this.areas.length - 1);`: This line generates a random index for the `areas` array.
- `this.areas[areaIndex].available = 0;`: This line sets the number of available spots in the randomly selected area to 0.
- `this.areas[areaIndex].direction = 1;`: This line sets the direction value of the randomly selected area to 1.
- `this.tick.bind(this);`: This line binds the `this` context of the `Booking` instance to the `tick` method. This ensures that when the `tick` method is called, `this` refers to the `Booking` instance.
- `observer.subscribe("TICK", () => this.tick());`: This line sets up a subscription to the "TICK" event. When the "TICK" event is emitted by the observer, the `tick` method of the `Booking` instance is called.
- `getData() { return this.areas.map(...); }`: The `getData` method returns a new array that is a copy of the `areas` array, but with each area object excluding the `direction` property. This could be used to display the current booking status to users.
- `reserveSpot(area, amount) { ... }`: The `reserveSpot` method handles the reservation of spots. It starts by converting `amount` to a number (`let cleanAmount = Number(amount);`). Then, it finds the area object for the given area (`const thisArea = this.areas.filter((a) => a.area === area)[0];`). If the area exists and has enough available spots, it reduces the number of available spots by the reservation amount (`thisArea.available -= cleanAmount;`), sets a timeout to automatically cancel the reservation after a certain duration, and stores information about the reservation.
- `const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { ... }, this.fest.reservationDuration);`: This line sets a timer that will execute the provided function after a delay of `this.fest.reservationDuration`. This function increases the available spots by `cleanAmount` and clears the timeout, effectively cancelling the reservation if it's not fulfilled within the reservation duration.
- `const id = uniqid();`: This line generates a unique ID for the reservation.
- `this.timeoutIds.push({ ... });`: This line adds an object to the `timeoutIds` array with information about the reservation, including a callback to clear the timeout, the reservation ID, the area, the expiration time of the reservation, and the amount reserved.
- `return { message: "Reserved", id, timeout: this.fest.reservationDuration, };`: If the reservation is successful, this line returns an object with a success message, the reservation ID, and the reservation duration.
- `else { return { error: "Invalid area, expired id or not enough available spots", status: 500, }; }`: If the reservation is unsuccessful, this line returns an object with an error message and a status code of 500.
- `fullfillReservation(id) { ... }`: This method accepts an ID as an argument and is responsible for fulfilling a reservation with that ID.
- `const obj = this.timeoutIds.find((e) => e.id === id);`: This line finds the reservation object in the `timeoutIds` array that matches the provided ID.
- `if (obj !== undefined && obj.expires > Date.now()) { ... }`: This checks if the reservation exists and if it hasn't expired. If both conditions are met, the reservation is fulfilled.
- `clearTimeout(obj.clearCallback);`: This line clears the timeout for the reservation, preventing it from being automatically cancelled.
- `this.timeoutIds.splice(this.timeoutIds.findIndex((e) => e.id === id), 1);`: This line removes the reservation object from the `timeoutIds` array, as the reservation has been fulfilled.
- `return { message: "Reservation completed" };`: If the reservation is fulfilled successfully, this line returns an object with a success message.
- `else { return { message: "ID not found", status: 500, }; }`: If the reservation can't be fulfilled, this line returns an object with an error message and a status code of 500.
- `tick() { ... }`: This method is called on every "TICK" event. It randomly selects an area and adjusts its available spots based on its `direction` property. If the number of available spots hits the lower or upper limit, the `direction` is reversed. This could simulate a fluctuation in the number of available spots due to reservations being made and cancelled.
- `module.exports = { Booking };`: This line exports the `Booking` class so it can be imported and used in other modules.

`src / EventLog.js`

```jsx
const { observer } = require("./util/observer");
const { events } = require("./util/events");
class EventLog {
  constructor() {
    this.events = [];
    observer.subscribe(events.CANCELLATION, (evt) => this.add(evt));
  }
  add(evt) {
    this.events.push(evt);
  }
  getEvents() {
    const copy = [...this.events];
    this.events = [];
    return copy;
  }
}
module.exports = { EventLog };
```

`const { observer } = require("./util/observer");`: This line is importing the `observer` object from the module located at `./util/observer`. The observer object is typically used in the Observer Design Pattern, which allows objects to notify other objects about changes in their state. In this case, it allows the application to listen for and respond to events.

`const { events } = require("./util/events");`: This line is importing an `events` object from the module located at `./util/events`. The `events` object likely contains definitions for various types of events that can be triggered and observed within the application.

`class EventLog { ... }`: Here we are defining a new class called `EventLog`. A class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific methods and properties in JavaScript.

`constructor() { ... }`: Inside the `EventLog` class, the `constructor` method is defined. This method is a special type of method in JavaScript classes that gets automatically called when a new instance of the class is created.

`this.events = [];`: This line inside the `constructor` method initializes an empty array and assigns it to the `events` property of the `EventLog` instance. This array will be used to store event logs.

`observer.subscribe(events.CANCELLATION, (evt) => this.add(evt));`: This line is subscribing the `EventLog` instance to the `CANCELLATION` event. This means that whenever the `CANCELLATION` event is triggered in the application, the `add` method of the `EventLog` instance will be called with the event data (`evt`) as its argument.

`add(evt) { ... }`: This is a method on the `EventLog` class that takes an event object (`evt`) as a parameter and adds it to the `events` array.

`this.events.push(evt);`: This line inside the `add` method is pushing the passed event object (`evt`) to the `events` array of the `EventLog` instance.

`getEvents() { ... }`: This is another method on the `EventLog` class. It is used to get all the events currently stored in the `events` array and then clear the array.

`const copy = [...this.events];`: This line creates a copy of the `events` array. The spread (`...`) operator is used to create a new array with the same elements as `this.events`.

`this.events = [];`: This line resets the `events` array, effectively clearing it.

`return copy;`: This line returns the copy of the `events` array that was created earlier. This ensures that the caller gets all the events that were in the array before it was cleared.

`module.exports = { EventLog };`: This line exports the `EventLog` class so that it can be `require`d and used in other JavaScript files in the

`src / Festival.js`

```jsx
const { observer } = require("./util/observer");
const { events } = require("./util/events");
const { initialSettings } = require("./static/settings");
class Festival {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.eventFrequency = initialSettings.eventFrequency;
    this.eventChance = initialSettings.eventChance;
    this.reservationDuration = initialSettings.reservationDuration;
    this.running = false;
  }
  start() {
    this.running = true;
    this.tick();
  }
  setEventChance(chance) {
    this.eventChance = chance;
  }
  setEventFrequency(freq) {
    if (Number(freq) < 2) {
      throw "Frequency too low (2 is minimum)";
    }
    this.eventFrequency = Number(freq);
  }
  setReservationDuration(duration) {
    this.reservationDuration = duration;
  }
  tick() {
    observer.publish(events.TICK);
    setTimeout(this.tick.bind(this), this.eventFrequency * 1000);
  }
}
module.exports = { Festival };
```

`const { observer } = require("./util/observer");`: This line is importing the `observer` object from the module at `./util/observer`. This `observer` is likely an instance of an Observer pattern implementation, which allows for subscribing to and publishing events.

`const { events } = require("./util/events");`: This line is importing an `events` object from the module at `./util/events`. This `events` object is likely a collection of constants or identifiers for different types of events that can be handled by the observer.

`const { initialSettings } = require("./static/settings");`: This line is importing an object named `initialSettings` from the module at `./static/settings`. This object likely contains default or initial settings for the Festival class.

`class Festival { ... }`: This line declares a new class named `Festival`. In JavaScript, a class is a type of function that is used to create objects with shared properties and methods.

Inside the `Festival` class, a `constructor` method is defined. The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. It takes one argument, `name`, which is presumably the name of the festival.

`this.name = name;`: This line assigns the `name` argument to the `name` property of the instance of the `Festival` class.

`this.eventFrequency = initialSettings.eventFrequency;`: This line assigns the `eventFrequency` property from the `initialSettings` object to the `eventFrequency` property of the Festival instance.

`this.eventChance = initialSettings.eventChance;`: Similarly, this line assigns the `eventChance` property from `initialSettings` to the `eventChance` property of the Festival instance.

`this.reservationDuration = initialSettings.reservationDuration;`: This line assigns the `reservationDuration` property from `initialSettings` to the `reservationDuration` property of the Festival instance.

`this.running = false;`: This line sets the `running` property of the Festival instance to `false`. This property probably indicates whether the festival is currently active or not.

`start() { ... }`: This method sets the `running` property to `true` and calls the `tick` method of the Festival instance. This likely starts the festival.

`setEventChance(chance) { ... }`: This method sets the `eventChance` property of the Festival instance to the `chance` argument. This likely changes the chance of a particular event occurring.

`setEventFrequency(freq) { ... }`: This method sets the `eventFrequency` property of the Festival instance to the `freq` argument, but only if `freq` is 2 or greater. Otherwise, it throws an error. This likely adjusts the frequency at which events occur.

Absolutely, let's continue from where we left off.

`setReservationDuration(duration) { ... }`: This method sets the `reservationDuration` property of the Festival instance to the `duration` argument. The `reservationDuration` likely controls how long reservations last in the context of the festival.

`tick() { ... }`: This method is likely the main loop for the Festival class. It's called to trigger an iteration of the event cycle for the festival.

`observer.publish(events.TICK);`: This line uses the `observer` instance to publish a `TICK` event. Publishing an event usually means notifying all parts of the application that have subscribed to that event type that the event has occurred. In this case, any part of the application that has subscribed to the `TICK` event will be notified.

`setTimeout(this.tick.bind(this), this.eventFrequency * 1000);`: This line uses JavaScript's built-in `setTimeout` function to schedule the `tick` method to be called again after a certain amount of time. The amount of time is specified by `this.eventFrequency * 1000`, which means that the `tick` method will be called every `eventFrequency` seconds (since `setTimeout`'s delay is in milliseconds). `this.tick.bind(this)` is used to ensure that when the `tick` method is called, `this` still refers to the Festival instance.

`module.exports = { Festival };`: This line exports the `Festival` class so that it can be imported and used in other JavaScript files in the application. The `Festival` class is exported as an object property, which means you can import it like this: `const { Festival } = require('./Festival');`.

The `Festival` class represents a festival with properties like `name`, `eventFrequency`, `eventChance`, `reservationDuration`, and `running`. It has methods to start the festival, set the event chance, set the event frequency, set the reservation duration, and a `tick` method that triggers a `TICK` event and schedules the next tick.

`src / foofest.js`

```jsx
//====================
const version = "0.0.1";
//====================

const { Schedule } = require("./Schedule.js");
const { Festival } = require("./Festival.js");
const { EventLog } = require("./EventLog");
const { Booking } = require("./Booking");
const Bands = require("./Bands.js");

function createFest(name) {
  const fest = new Festival(name);

  fest.booking = new Booking(fest);
  fest.start();
  return fest;
}

const fest = createFest("FooFest");
module.exports = {
  FooFest: fest,
};
```

`const version = "0.0.1";`: A version string is being assigned to the constant `version`. This is likely used for tracking the current version of this module or application.

`const { Schedule } = require("./Schedule.js");`: This line imports the `Schedule` class from the `Schedule.js` file in the same directory.

`const { Festival } = require("./Festival.js");`: This line imports the `Festival` class from the `Festival.js` file in the same directory.

`const { EventLog } = require("./EventLog");`: This line imports the `EventLog` class from the `EventLog.js` file in the same directory.

`const { Booking } = require("./Booking");`: This line imports the `Booking` class from the `Booking.js` file in the same directory.

`const Bands = require("./Bands.js");`: This line imports the `Bands` data from the `Bands.js` file in the same directory.

`function createFest(name) { ... }`: This function `createFest` is used to create and return a new instance of a `Festival` with related instances of `Schedule`, `EventLog`, `Booking` objects, and data about `Bands`. The `name` parameter is the name of the festival.

`const fest = new Festival(name);`: This line creates a new `Festival` object and assigns it to the `fest` constant. The festival is given the `name` passed to the `createFest` function.

`const schedule = new Schedule(fest);`: This line creates a new `Schedule` object and assigns it to the `schedule` constant. The `Schedule` object is instantiated with the `Festival` object.

`fest.schedule = schedule.slots;`: This line adds the `slots` property from the `Schedule` object to the `Festival` object under the `schedule` property.

`fest.bands = Bands;`: This line adds the `Bands` data to the `Festival` object under the `bands` property.

`const eventLog = new EventLog();`: This line creates a new `EventLog` object and assigns it to the `eventLog` constant.

`fest.eventLog = eventLog;`: This line adds the `EventLog` object to the `Festival` object under the `eventLog` property.

`fest.booking = new Booking(fest);`: This line creates a new `Booking` object, instantiated with the `Festival` object, and assigns it directly to the `booking` property of the `Festival` object.

`fest.start();`: This line calls the `start` method on the `Festival` object, which presumably begins the operation of the festival.

`return fest;`: This line returns the `Festival` object from the `createFest` function. The festival is now fully set up with its schedule, bands, event log, and booking system.

`const fest = createFest("FooFest");`: This line creates a new festival named "FooFest" by calling the `createFest` function and assigns the returned `Festival` object to the `fest` constant.

`module.exports = { FooFest: fest, };`: This line exports the `Festival` object under the property `FooFest`. This means that other modules can import the `FooFest` object using `require`.

This script is essentially a factory for creating a **`Festival`** object with a specific setup. The **`Festival`** object encapsulates all the functionality and data needed for a festival, including a **`Schedule`**, **`EventLog`**, **`Booking`** system, and **`Bands`** data. The **`createFest`** function allows for easy creation of a new **`Festival`** with a specified name, and this function is used to create a **`Festival`** named "FooFest". The "FooFest" **`Festival`** object is then exported for use in other modules.

```

This code defines a class `Schedule` that is responsible for creating and managing the schedule of a festival. Let's go over it line by line:

**`const bands = require("./static/bands.json");`**: This line imports band data from a JSON file. The band data likely includes details about each band that will be playing at the festival.

**`const { shuffle } = require("./util/shuffle");`**: This line imports a **`shuffle`** function from a module stored in the 'util' folder. Shuffling is a common operation when you want to randomize the order of items in a list.

**`const { numberToTime } = require("./util/numberToTime");`**: This line imports a utility function **`numberToTime`** that presumably converts a numeric representation of time into a more human-readable format.

**`const { rndBetween, rndBetweenEven } = require("./util/rnd");`**: This line imports two functions for generating random numbers within a range. **`rndBetween`** likely returns a random number between two values, while **`rndBetweenEven`** probably returns a random even number between two values.

**`const { observer } = require("./util/observer");`**: This line imports an **`observer`** from a module in the 'util' folder. The **`observer`** is likely an instance of the Observer pattern, used here for managing event-driven code.

**`const { events } = require("./util/events");`**: This line imports an **`events`** object from a module in the 'util' folder. This object likely contains string constants representing different types of events that can occur during the festival. The event names are stored as constants to prevent errors due to typos and to allow for easy refactoring.

`class Schedule {...}` defines the `Schedule` class.

`constructor(fest) {...}` is the constructor of the class that initializes the instance with the festival data, scene and day data, and an empty schedule.

`tick() {...}` is a method that checks at each tick (invoked at regular intervals) if a random event should occur based on the festival's `eventChance`. If so, it randomly picks a scene, day, and slot and cancels the event at that slot. It also publishes a `CANCELLATION` event to notify other parts of the application.

`_setEmptyStage() {...}` is a method that returns an empty schedule structure for a stage.

`fillSlots() {...}` is a method that fills the schedule with band names. It creates a copy of the band names, shuffles them, and then slices this shuffled array into three parts to assign each part to a different stage.

`_fillStage(stage, acts) {...}` is a method that fills a specific stage's schedule with the provided acts. It slices the acts array into seven parts (for seven days) and assigns each part to a day.

`_addBreaks(acts) {...}` is a method that takes an array of acts and returns a new array where each act is followed by a break. The start and end times of the acts and breaks are calculated based on a 4-hour slot (2 hours for the act and 2 hours for the break).

`module.exports = { Schedule };` exports the `Schedule` class so it can be used in other modules.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive model for managing the schedule of a festival, including creating the schedule, filling it with bands, and handling event cancellations with events being randomly cancelled.

`src/ util/ events.js`

```jsx
const events = {
  TICK: "TICK",
  CANCELLATION: "CANCELLATION",
};
module.exports = { events };
```

This module exports an object named `events` which contains two properties: `TICK` and `CANCELLATION`. Both properties are string types and their values are equal to their keys.

`const events = { TICK: "TICK", CANCELLATION: "CANCELLATION" };`: This line defines the `events` object. Each key-value pair in the object is an event type that can occur in the application. Using this object makes the code more robust to typing errors, as any misspelled event type will result in an undefined value rather than silently using the incorrect string. It also makes it easier to change the names of these event types in the future, as you only need to change the string in one place rather than everywhere it's used in the code.

`module.exports = { events };`: This line exports the `events` object so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application. The use of brackets around `events` in the export statement is a shorthand syntax for `{ events: events }`. This syntax works when the property name and the variable name are the same.

In the context of the application, these events might be used with an event emitter or a similar mechanism to signal that a certain action has taken place. For example, `TICK` might be emitted on every iteration of a main loop, and `CANCELLATION` might be emitted when a band's performance is cancelled.

`src/ util/ numberToTimes.js`

```jsx
function numberToTime(num) {
  if (String(num).length === 2) {
    return num + ":00";
  }
  return `0${num}:00`;
}
module.exports = { numberToTime };
```

This module exports a single function, `numberToTime`, which converts a numerical representation of an hour into a string representation of time, in the "HH:MM" format.

`function numberToTime(num) {`: This line declares a function named `numberToTime` that accepts one argument, `num`, which represents an hour of the day.

`if (String(num).length === 2) {`: This line checks if the length of the string representation of `num` is exactly 2. This would be true for two-digit numbers, i.e., the numbers from 10 to 24.

`return num + ":00";`: If the length is 2 (i.e., the number is two digits), the function returns a string in the format "HH:00", where HH is the original number. For example, if `num` was 12, it would return "12:00".

`return` 0${num}:00`;`: If the length is not 2 (i.e., the number is a single digit), the function returns a string in the format "0H:00", where H is the original number. This is achieved using a template literal, which is a way to embed expressions within string literals. For example, if `num` was 5, it would return "05:00".

`module.exports = { numberToTime };`: This line exports the `numberToTime` function so it can be used in other modules.

This function is useful when working with time in situations where time needs to be represented consistently as a string, such as in user interfaces, databases, or third-party APIs.

`src/ util/ observer.js`

```jsx
const observer = (function () {
  "use strict";
  const events = {};
  return {
    subscribe: function (ev, callback) {
      if (!events.hasOwnProperty(ev)) {
        events[ev] = [];
      }
      events[ev].push(callback);
    },
    publish: function (ev) {
      //console.log("Broadcasting: ", ev);
      let data = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
      let index = 0;
      let length = 0;
      if (events.hasOwnProperty(ev)) {
        length = events[ev].length;
        for (; index < length; index++) {
          events[ev][index].apply(this, data);
        }
      }
    },
    unsubscribe: function (ev, callback) {
      let x = events[ev].indexOf(callback);
      events[ev].splice(x, 1);
    },
  };
})();
module.exports = { observer };
```

This script creates an `observer` object that implements the Publish-Subscribe pattern (also known as Pub-Sub), which is a messaging pattern used in software architecture. The Pub-Sub pattern allows for loose coupling between components, where the sender (publisher) does not need to know about the receivers (subscribers).

`const observer = (function () {`: An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is used to create an `observer` object. IIFEs run as soon as they are defined.

`"use strict";`: This line enforces Strict Mode, a feature in ECMAScript 5 and later that catches common coding errors and "unsafe" actions such as defining global variables.

`const events = {};`: This line declares an object `events` that will be used to store event names and their corresponding callback functions.

`return {`: This starts the definition of the object that will be returned by the IIFE and assigned to `observer`.

`subscribe: function (ev, callback) {`: This method allows components to subscribe to an event. It takes an event name `ev` and a `callback` function as parameters.

`if (!events.hasOwnProperty(ev)) {`: This line checks if the `events` object already has a property named `ev`. If not, it creates an empty array for that event.

`events[ev].push(callback);`: This line adds the `callback` function to the array of callbacks for this event.

`publish: function (ev) {`: This method allows components to publish an event. It takes an event name `ev` and any number of additional arguments.

`let data = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);`: This line creates an array `data` containing all arguments passed to `publish` after the first one (the event name).

`if (events.hasOwnProperty(ev)) {`: This checks if there are any subscribers to the event. If so, it calls all the callback functions associated with that event, passing the `data` as arguments.

`unsubscribe: function (ev, callback) {`: This method allows components to unsubscribe from an event. It removes the `callback` function from the array of callbacks for the event `ev`.

`})();`: These parentheses immediately invoke the function expression defined at the start.

`module.exports = { observer };`: This exports the `observer` object so it can be used in other modules.

In summary, this module provides a simple way for different parts of an application to communicate with each other without needing to be directly connected. Components can broadcast events (with the `publish` method) or listen for events (with the `subscribe` method). The `unsubscribe` method allows for cleanup, preventing potential memory leaks.

`src/ util/ rnd.js`

```jsx
function rndBetween(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(
    Math.random() * (Number(max) - Number(min) + 1) + Number(min)
  );
}
function rndBetweenEven(min, max) {
  const number = Math.floor((Math.random() * max) / 2) * 2 + min;
  return number;
}

module.exports = { rndBetween, rndBetweenEven };
```

This script exports two utility functions `rndBetween` and `rndBetweenEven` for generating random numbers within a specified range. Here is the detailed explanation:

`function rndBetween(min, max) {`: This function generates a random integer between `min` and `max` (both inclusive).

- `Math.random() * (Number(max) - Number(min) + 1) + Number(min)`: This expression generates a random floating-point number between `min` and `max`, inclusive of `min` and exclusive of `max`.
- `Math.floor(...)`: This function rounds down the resulting floating-point number to the nearest integer.

`function rndBetweenEven(min, max) {`: This function generates a random even integer between `min` and `max` (both inclusive).

- `Math.floor((Math.random() * max) / 2) * 2 + min`: This expression generates a random even number between `min` and `max`. It works by first generating a random floating-point number between 0 and `max`, dividing it by 2, rounding down to the nearest integer, then multiplying by 2 to get an even number. This ensures that the random number is even. The `+ min` at the end shifts the range to start from `min`.

`module.exports = { rndBetween, rndBetweenEven };`: This exports the `rndBetween` and `rndBetweenEven` functions so they can be used in other modules.

`src/ util/ shuffle.js`

```jsx
/* Randomize array in-place using Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm */
function shuffle(array) {
  for (var i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    var j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    var temp = array[i];
    array[i] = array[j];
    array[j] = temp;
  }
}
module.exports = { shuffle };
```

This JavaScript module exports a single function named `shuffle` which is used to shuffle or randomize the elements of an array in-place. The shuffle operation is performed based on the Durstenfeld version of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.

`function shuffle(array) {`: This function declaration starts the definition of the `shuffle` function, which takes one argument, `array`. The `array` argument should be the array that you want to shuffle.

`for (var i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {`: This `for` loop starts with `i` set to the last index of the array and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0, decrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration. This allows the function to iterate backwards through the array.

`var j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));`: Inside the loop, a random index `j` is generated. `j` can be any integer between 0 and `i`, inclusive.

`var temp = array[i];`: A temporary variable `temp` is used to hold the current value of `array[i]`.

`array[i] = array[j];`: The element at index `j` is then placed into the position at index `i`.

`array[j] = temp;`: The original value of `array[i]`, which was saved in `temp`, is placed at index `j`. This effectively swaps the values at indices `i` and `j`.

`module.exports = { shuffle };`: Finally, the `shuffle` function is exported so it can be used in other JavaScript modules.

The Durstenfeld shuffle is an optimized version of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, which reduces the number of swaps compared to the original Fisher-Yates algorithm. This function modifies the input array in-place, meaning that it does not create a new array but instead alters the original array.

`src/ static/ settings.js`

```jsx
const initialSettings = {
  eventFrequency: 10, //seconds
  eventChance: 1, //percent
  reservationDuration: 60 * 5 * 1000, //milliseconds
  imageWidth: 720,
  imageHeight: 480,
  version: "0.0.4",
};
module.exports = { initialSettings };
```

This JavaScript module exports an object called `initialSettings` that holds the initial settings for the application. 

`const initialSettings = {`: This line starts the definition of an object literal called `initialSettings`.

`eventFrequency: 10, //seconds`: This property sets the frequency of events to 10 seconds. This value can be used for scheduling events or actions at regular intervals.

`eventChance: 1, //percent`: This property sets the chance of an event happening to 1 percent. This could be used, for example, to determine whether a random event should occur during a given time period.

`reservationDuration: 60 * 5 * 1000, //milliseconds`: This property sets the duration of a reservation to 300,000 milliseconds, or 5 minutes. This might be used to determine how long a user's reservation is held before it is automatically cancelled if not confirmed.

`imageWidth: 720,`: This property sets the width of an image to 720 pixels. This could be used when generating or resizing images for the application.

`imageHeight: 480,`: This property sets the height of an image to 480 pixels, which could be used in a similar way as `imageWidth`.

`version: "0.0.4",`: This property sets the version of the application to "0.0.4".

`module.exports = { initialSettings };`: Finally, the `initialSettings` object is exported so it can be used in other JavaScript modules. This allows these settings to be centrally managed and easily shared across different parts of the application.

`server.js`

```jsx
/* eslint-env node, es6 */
const express = require("express");
var app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

```

This script is a server application written in Node.js using the Express.js framework. It's designed to serve data for a festival application FooFest.

The application includes several routes that respond to HTTP GET, POST, and PUT requests:

**GET /bands:** This route returns a list of all bands performing at FooFest.

**GET /bands/:slug:** This route returns information about a specific band, identified by the `slug` parameter in the URL.

**GET /schedule and GET /schedule/:day:** These routes return the festival's schedule. The latter is designed to return information for a specific day, though it currently returns the full schedule regardless of the `day` parameter.

**GET /events:** This route returns a log of events at FooFest.

**GET /available-spots:** This route returns information about available camping spots that can be booked.

**POST /settings:** This route allows the user to modify certain settings, such as the frequency and chance of events, and the duration of reservations.

**PUT /reserve-spot:** This route allows a user to reserve a number of camping spots in a specific area.

**POST /fullfill-reservation:** This route finalizes a reservation made with the `/reserve-spot` route.

The server is set to listen on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable, or port 8080 if the `PORT` variable is not set.

The script also includes some middleware for handling JSON and URL-encoded request bodies, serving static files from the `public` directory, and setting CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests.

There's also a `TODO` comment in the `/schedule/:day` route, suggesting that the developer may not want to include the `day` parameter in the final version of the application.

Please note that this script requires the `express` package and two local modules, `./src/foofest` and `./src/static/settings`. Make sure these dependencies are installed and available in your project.

```
const express = require("express");

```

This line imports the Express.js library into your application.

```
var app = express();

```

This line creates an instance of an Express application, which is used to set up the server.

```
app.use(express.json());

```

This line adds a middleware to parse JSON bodies from the HTTP requests. This is required to read JSON data sent in the POST body.

```
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

```

This middleware is used to parse URL-encoded bodies. The `extended` option allows parsing of nested objects, which means you can have nested data in your POST requests.

```
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
    "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept"
  );
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, OPTIONS");
  next();
});

```

This middleware function sets up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers. CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin.

```
app.use(express.static("public"));

```

This line serves static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files from the `public` directory.

```
const { FooFest } = require("./src/foofest");
const { initialSettings } = require("./src/static/settings");

```

These lines import local modules from the project. `FooFest`contains festival-related data and functionality, while `initialSettings` might contain initial configuration options for the application.

```
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.json({
    isMyServerLive: true,
    suggestions: "Try visiting /bands",
  });
});

```

This code sets up a GET route at the root ("/") URL path. When a client sends a GET request to the root URL, the server will respond with a JSON object containing the server status and a suggestion for the next step.

```
app.get("/bands", function (req, res) {
  res.json(FooFest.bands);
});

```

This route handles GET requests to "/bands" and responds with the data stored in `FooFest.bands`.

```
app.get("/bands/:slug", function (req, res) {
  const slug = req.params.slug;
  res.json(FooFest.bands.find((band) => band.slug === slug));
});

```

This route handles GET requests to "/bands/:slug". The ":slug" is a route parameter, essentially a variable that you can use to capture values in the URL. In this case, it's used to find a specific band based on its "slug", which is probably a unique identifier. The band is found by iterating over `FooFest.bands` and comparing each band's slug to the requested slug.

```
app.get("/schedule", function (req, res) {
  res.json(FooFest.schedule);
});

```

This route handles GET requests to "/schedule" and responds with the data stored in `FooFest.schedule`.

```
app.get("/version", function (req, res) {
  res.json({ version: initialSettings.version });
});

```

This route responds to GET requests to "/version" by returning the current version of the application, which is stored in `initialSettings.version`.

```
app.get("/schedule/:day", function (req, res) {
  const day = parseInt(req.params.day);
  res.json(FooFest.schedule);
});

```

This route handles GET requests to "/schedule/:day", with ":day" being a route parameter for the day of the week. However, this route currently doesn't use the "day" parameter, it just returns the full schedule.

```
app.get("/events", function (req, res) {
  res.json(FooFest.eventLog.getEvents());
});

```

This route handles GET requests to "/events" by responding with an array of events obtained by calling the `getEvents()` method on `FooFest.eventLog`.

```
app.get("/available-spots", function (req, res) {
  res.json(FooFest.booking.getData());
});

```

This route handles GET requests to "/available-spots" and responds with booking data obtained by calling the `getData()` method on `FooFest.booking`.

```
app.post("/settings", function (req, res) {
  const structure = req.body;
  if (structure.eventFrequency) {
    FooFest.setEventFrequency(structure.eventFrequency);
  }
  // more code here
});

```

This route handles POST requests to "/settings". It reads data from the request body and updates the festival's settings based on this data. The function is executed when the server receives a POST request at the "/settings" endpoint.

```
app.post("/settings", function (req, res) {

```

This line sets up a POST endpoint at "/settings". The `function (req, res)` is the callback function that will be executed when a POST request is made to this endpoint. The `req` object represents the HTTP request and contains properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. The `res` object is used to formulate an HTTP response.

```
  const structure = req.body;

```

The `req.body` object contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body. This data is parsed and stored in the `structure` constant.

The next sections check whether specific properties exist in the `structure` object and, if they do, call corresponding methods of `FooFest`:

```
  if (structure.eventFrequency) {
    FooFest.setEventFrequency(structure.eventFrequency);
  }
  if (structure.eventChance) {
    FooFest.setEventChance(structure.eventChance);
  }
  if (structure.reservationDuration) {
    FooFest.setReservationDuration(structure.reservationDuration);
  }

```

Each `if` condition checks if a particular property (`eventFrequency`, `eventChance`, or `reservationDuration`) exists in the `structure` object (i.e., it's not `undefined` or `null`). If it exists, the corresponding setter method on the `FooFest` object is called with the property's value.

```
  if (
    !structure.eventFrequency &&
    !structure.eventChance &&
    !structure.reservationDuration
  ) {

```

This condition checks if none of the properties (`eventFrequency`, `eventChance`, and `reservationDuration`) exist in the `structure` object. The `!` operator negates the value, so it returns `true` if the property is `undefined` or `null`.

```
    res.send({
      error:
        "Wrong data format supplied, need 'eventFrequency', 'reservationDuration', or 'eventChance'",
      status: 500,
    });

```

If none of the properties exist in the `structure` object, an error message is sent back to the client with a status of 500. This is done using `res.send()`, which sends the HTTP response.

```
  } else {
    res.send({
      message: "Changed settings",
    });
  }
});

```

If at least one of the properties exists in the `structure` object, a success message ("Changed settings") is sent back to the client. The function ends with a closing parenthesis and semicolon to finish the `app.post` method call.

This route handler allows clients to change settings of `FooFest` by sending a POST request with new settings in the request body. If the provided data doesn't match the expected format, it responds with an error; otherwise, it updates the settings and responds with a success message.

```
app.put("/reserve-spot", function (req, res) {
  if (Number(req.body.amount) < 1) {
    res.send({
      error: `Unable to reserve ${req.body.amount} spots`,
      status: 500,
    });
  }
  res.send(FooFest.booking.reserveSpot(req.body.area, req.body.amount));
});

```

This route handles PUT requests to "/reserve-spot". It reads an "amount" and an "area" from the request body and attempts to reserve that number of spots in the specified area.

In general, the methods you see here (GET, POST, PUT) are HTTP methods, representing different types of requests a client can make to a server. GET is for retrieving data, POST is for sending data to be processed by the server, and PUT is for updating existing data. These methods are part of the standard HTTP protocol and are not specific to Express or Node.js. The properties (like `req.body` and `req.params`) are part of the request (**`req`**) object provided by Express when a request is made to the server.

**`req.body`** is an object that contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body. In the case of the "/settings" and "/reserve-spot" routes, **`req.body`** is used to access the data sent with the POST and PUT requests.

**`req.params`** is an object that contains properties mapped to the named route parameters. For instance, in the "/bands/:slug" route, **`req.params.slug`** is used to access the value of the "slug" parameter from the route path.

Lastly, **`res.json()`** is a method on the response object (**`res`**) that sends a JSON response. This method converts the given parameter to a JSON string using JSON.stringify(), sets the Content-Type response HTTP header field to 'application/json', and sends the data back to the client.

**`res.send()`** is similar, but it doesn't explicitly convert the parameter to a JSON string. Instead, it determines the type of the response based on the argument you pass to it. If you pass it an object or array, it will send it as JSON, but you can also pass it other types like a string or a Buffer, and it will send the data as-is.

```
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);

```

Tells the application to listen for HTTP requests on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable, or port 8080 if `PORT` is not set. The environment variable allows the port to be set by the server's environment, which is useful when deploying the application to a platform like Heroku.
